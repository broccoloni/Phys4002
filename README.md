# Phys4002
This was my physics project in the 4th year of my undergraduate degree. The task was to calculate
the location of the neutrino surface based on the reactions occuring within a 2D hydrodynamic.
simulation of an accrection disk. 

All of the function definitions are in nsurface.py. opticalcolor.p is a gnuplot script to plot 
heatmaps of the accretion disk data with the neutrino surface, as shown below
